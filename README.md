# README - ASP.NET MVC Application

This README file provides concise instructions on how to set up and run an ASP.NET MVC application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

## Setup and Run

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/leticiatakenaka/github-profiles
    ```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.

3. Make sure the project is configured for the correct version of .NET Core.

4. Restore NuGet dependencies:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

5. Press F5 to build and run the application.

6. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:port` (default port is usually 5000).

The ASP.NET MVC application should now be running on your local machine.

## Additional Notes

- Adjust environment settings in `appsettings.json` if necessary.

- For production environments, consider publishing the application and configuring an appropriate web server.

I hope these instructions help you set up and run the ASP.NET MVC application successfully! If you encounter issues, check the framework-specific documentation or seek assistance from the community.
